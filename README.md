# Perlin Noise Implementation and Visualization

This project involves the implementation and visualization of Perlin noise using Python. Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise used extensively in computer graphics to create natural-looking textures, terrains, and other procedural content.

## Project Overview

### Description

Perlin noise is a gradient noise function that generates smooth, continuous, and pseudo-random patterns. It is widely used in computer graphics for creating natural-looking textures and terrains. This project implements Perlin noise and visualizes it using a Jupyter notebook.

### Features

- **Gradient-Based Noise**: The implementation of Perlin noise based on gradient vectors.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Produces smooth transitions between noise values, ideal for natural textures.
- **Multi-Dimensional Support**: Capable of generating Perlin noise in 1D, 2D, and potentially higher dimensions.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to visualize the generated Perlin noise patterns.

## File Structure

- `FINAL_Konsing_ProgrammingAssignment1.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and visualization of Perlin noise.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
